1. Install and Use Jupyter Notebook

2. Open NurseBot.ipynb with Jupyter Notebook

3. Select "Run All" from a tab called "Cell"

4. The chatbot system GUI will appear and simply type a message and press 'Send' button to the NurseBot and the chatbot will respond back. 

(NOTE: The very first time the user send a message to the chatbot may take seconds for the chatbot to respond since it takes time to process the chatbot framework with loaded trained model and dataset.)
